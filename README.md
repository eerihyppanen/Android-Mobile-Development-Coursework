Note that the video it was recorded with different emulator phone that the one i used in the making of the project. Thats why the new phones bottom navigation thing clips litlle over the buttons. The original phone had diffenrent screen and navigation bar and the UI was good fit.

The project can be run from the file, it can be loaded and opened in Android Studio, I also provide link to projects original git "https://github.com/eerihyppanen/Kalastus-sovellus.git"
